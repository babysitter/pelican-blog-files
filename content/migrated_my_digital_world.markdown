Title: my digital world
Date: 2016-05-05 10:00

i am literally one step from gettin' my own little digital world.
 all my life i shared a pc with somebody but now i'm gonna get
 one, and it will become **my** kingdom. nothing fancy, a 13.3" acer but
 it will make *difference*. hopefully this is my door to the better
 OS understanding.
