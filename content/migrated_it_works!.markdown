Title: it works!
Date: 2016-05-16 16:00

it's alive!.. kind of. my gentoo is growing, x-server, xfce, now i've got
 my alsa working! and now this is my first post from the gentoo device
 which is awesome. my urxvt is looking very good with solarized theme and
 inconsolatos font, still my favorite terminal emulator.

ok, ok. i still need to force the wi-fi to work, my touchpad config is
 terrible and there is no battery manager **but totally worth it**.
