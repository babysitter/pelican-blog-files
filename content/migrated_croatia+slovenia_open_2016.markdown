great time for defenders btw! there was no chinese monsters there, so joo
 had no big troubles in the men's event in zagreb, in the women's contest
 hitomi sato defeated all japanese select team and won the title. defence
 won both gold prises, pretty good huh?

 but in slovenia mizutani kicked yuto and joo from the tournament in 1/4
 and 1/2 respectively so better luck next time, big win for jun!
