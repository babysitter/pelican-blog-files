Title: bake weakness
Date: 2016-05-11 14:00

i'm having some problems with bake. because post-files
 are pure markdown no metadata is stored about date or
 even post order. the developer is working on the new version
 which will solve that problem completely, but now i'm trying
 to fix that with bash scripting.
