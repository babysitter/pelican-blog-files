this should really help - will put here a log of my productive activities.
 because now i literally got out of practice. hope it will help.
 so.. for today:

- wrote a plain c code for parsing processes cmdlines' via /proc
- wrote a very simple posix daemon - plain c
- _again_ researching strange behavior of a move constructor
