this another absolutely useless blog was created with 
[the bake project](https://github.com/felipetavares/bake)
 and placed here on github with their [github.io][io] service.
 it is quite awesome so go and check it out.

this dark and forgotten place will be used to collect a bunch of
 links and thoughts about everething that i like and hate.

farewell stranger
