Title: my getnoo troubles
Date: 2016-06-05 19:00

so, since i've got my gentoo system installed the main thing i do with is -
 fixing problems. a lot. all kinds of problems. and i'm still so bad.. gosh.

 so there is a list what i absolutely need to fix:

- ACPI fails -> not able to get my charge percent even
- xfce settings - touchpad and themes -> cant enable tap-click
- Enable hardware 3D acceleration cause video playback is terrible
- After that add wigets for keyboard layout and wireless network

actually it isn't that bad already. i recompiled firefox with gstreamer and
 moc with curl - so online radios is working fine everywhere. switched
 colors to gruvbox and fixed vim-urxvt-transparency problem by getting newer
 version of vim from the test branch of portage.
