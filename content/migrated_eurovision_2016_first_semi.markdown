Title: eurovision 2016 first semi
Date: 2016-05-11 15:00

i love eurovision, you know, but i dont really love
 all that songs(_mostly crap_), i like the spirit of it.
 yeah.. i know, but for me it's like olympics. and i can
 forgive them all that stupid politics, forcing trans-genders
 and even bad music. it reminds me about good old times when
 i'm guessing who is going to the finals with a pan and piece
 of paper. anyways! 8/10 this time:

i wrote 11 teams including **bosnia**, **moldova** and **malta**.  
but only 10 countries go to the final so i dropped malta and was wrong.  
**netherlands** was unpredictable to me, still think _bosnia_ was better.
