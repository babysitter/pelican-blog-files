depressing times, a lot of thinking about world imperfections. that is soo
 stupid, whining like a little baby, but i can't resist, it's ok. just have
 a lot of things to do and no mind to do that at all.


finished that primitive linux system programming course, got 100% certificate.
 whatever, not even filling good about that, but it wasn't totally worthless.
 watched westworld series, one season story -- not bad, not quite obvious, thanks
 again nolan! reading harry potter and methods of rationality, not _great_, but
 it is really hard to stop reading. didn't get that filling for a long time,
 just want to read a lot. first day of warcraft wca tournament, our guys didn't
 do very well, but its ok. ork worker killed infi 2 - 0, that was cool.
