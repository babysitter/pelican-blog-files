well.. a lot of things have happened  
a lot of things are happening right now  
but basic things are the same.

doing my best to improve my c++ skills to get a diecent job when
my contract will expire, going to write a portable tool for
emulating localization algorithms in WSNs for my thesis.

my gentoo got its updates recently, A LOT.. hours and hours of compiling.
 new 4.4.21 kernel installed this morning.

watching new [cppcon 2016][1] videos and listening to the [cppcasts][2]  
going to go to the [local c++ group meeting][3], hope will worth it

i will try to post here more often,  
this can be very useful in many ways.
